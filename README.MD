### This repository was made as a complementary to *[WarThunder-Data](https://github.com/MoleSchizo/WarThunder-Data)* which has War Thunder structures accross multiple game versions along with *[War-Thunder Reversal Thread on UnknownCheats](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/other-mmorpg-and-strategy/85949-war-thunder.html)*. 

- I will be updating this repository as time goes on, the earlier game versions have dumped game executables aswell but I realized its a bit time consuming.





## Contributing

Contributions are appreciated. If I ever do miss an update and you have a copy of that game version It would be very beneficial if you could contribute by sharing it with us.

In the newer game versions, I keep a small list of offsets. Mainly the useful global values like localplayer, playerlist, gamecontext etc. But if there is a specific value you would like me to keep updated please open up an issue and post it's signature ***OR*** its offset along with the game version so i can make a signature myself. This is mainly to make the reversing process slightly easier at the start if you don't want to open up the game or spend too much time trying to find these.
